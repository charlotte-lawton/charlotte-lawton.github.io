        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Hockey Game Simulation project is a Python-based simulation that models a simplified hockey game between two teams. The program uses random number generation to determine puck control, shot attempts, goals, and other in-game events. The goal of the simulation is to create a dynamic, automated hockey match where different game scenarios play out based on statistical probabilities.

    <!-- Challenges and Learnings -->
    <section class="project-challenges">
        <h2>Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            One of the main challenges in this project was designing a game structure that felt dynamic and realistic while maintaining simplicity. Since hockey is a fast-paced game with many variables, simplifying player interactions and game mechanics without losing the essence of the sport required careful consideration. Using random number generation helped introduce variability, but balancing probabilities to create a fair and engaging game was an iterative process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another challenge was ensuring the program ran smoothly without errors in logic or flow. Debugging issues related to tracking goals, ensuring fair team advantages, and structuring the game loop effectively provided valuable problem-solving experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this project, I learned more about using Python for simulation modeling and game design. It reinforced my understanding of probability-driven simulations and logic-based decision-making, which can be applied to more complex modeling projects in the future. Additionally, working on this project sparked my interest in creating interactive simulations that blend mathematics and programming.
