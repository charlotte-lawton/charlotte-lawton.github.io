        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Impact of Oil Spills on the Northeast Arctic Cod Population project analyzed how oil spill toxicity affects cod populations in the Barents Sea, a critical fishing ground for Northeast Arctic cod. Using a mathematical model, the study simulated population changes by incorporating factors such as birth rates, death rates, and oil toxicity levels. The results demonstrated that oil spills significantly impact juvenile cod, causing a sharp decline in their population, which in turn affects future adult populations. However, the model also indicated that surviving cod can recover over time, with lower toxicity spills leading to faster population stabilization.

        <h2>Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            One of the main challenges in this project was ensuring that the model accurately reflected real-world ecological dynamics. Simplifying assumptions—such as constant reproduction rates and uniform oil toxicity effects—helped streamline calculations but also introduced limitations in capturing the full complexity of cod population dynamics. To address this, the model was adjusted to account for different toxicity levels, revealing how varying oil spill intensities influence recovery rates.

            Additionally, interpreting the results required careful consideration of how juvenile mortality influences long-term population stability. The model showed that while oil spills initially cause dramatic population declines, cod populations can recover under certain conditions. This highlighted the resilience of the species but also underscored the importance of minimizing oil pollution to prevent long-term ecological disruptions.

            Through this project, I gained valuable experience in applying mathematical models to real-world environmental problems. It deepened my understanding of population dynamics and ecological modeling while reinforcing my interest in using quantitative reasoning to analyze environmental issues. This work also strengthened my ability to interpret scientific data and apply it to sustainability challenges, particularly in marine ecosystems.
