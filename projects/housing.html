        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project aimed to address the housing shortages in Bennington and Windham counties. My team conducted an extensive analysis to identify towns well-positioned for housing development, incorporating GIS mapping and a ranking system to evaluate key factors such as existing infrastructure, zoning laws, and floodplain policies. The final outcome provided the Brattleboro Development Credit Corporation (BDCC) with a strategic framework for targeted housing initiatives, balancing growth with sustainability.

    <!-- Challenges and Learnings -->
    <section class="project-challenges">
        <h2>Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            One of the main challenges we encountered in this project was working with outdated or incomplete GIS datasets. Some data, such as floodplain maps and wastewater infrastructure records, did not reflect recent developments, making it difficult to provide a fully accurate assessment of housing feasibility. Additionally, the absence of a drinking water infrastructure dataset limited our ability to evaluate which towns had the necessary systems in place to support expansion. To address these issues, we supplemented GIS data with qualitative research, including town plans, regional reports, and stakeholder interviews. However, we recognize that incorporating more up-to-date datasets in the future would significantly improve the accuracy of our findings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another difficulty was the inconsistency in town plan information. Some towns had extensive documentation on housing policies, while others lacked relevant details, leading to gaps in our ranking system. Initially, these missing data points resulted in towns being penalized unfairly. To mitigate this, we adjusted our ranking methodology to account for incomplete information, ensuring that towns were not automatically ranked lower due to a lack of available data. Moving forward, refining the ranking system by introducing alternative indicators or assigning confidence levels to missing data could further improve the fairness of our assessments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stakeholder coordination was another key challenge. Gathering insights from town officials, regional planners, and housing experts required significant outreach and follow-ups. Some stakeholders were responsive and provided valuable insights, while others were harder to engage. Despite these difficulties, our team successfully built connections with experts and policymakers, which allowed us to refine our methodology and validate our findings. This experience reinforced the importance of clear communication and persistence when working on community-focused projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I learned a lot from this project about the intersection of spatial data analysis and housing policy. It deepened my understanding of how infrastructure, zoning laws, and environmental factors shape housing development and how data-driven approaches can inform strategic planning. Working with GIS reinforced my interest in spatial analysis, and I enjoyed the process of translating complex datasets into visual insights that could support decision-making. Additionally, this project gave me valuable experience in engaging with infrastructure policies and understanding how regulatory frameworks impact development at the local level. These insights have strengthened my interest in working with data-driven solutions for real-world challenges, particularly in areas related to housing, environmental planning, and sustainable development.
